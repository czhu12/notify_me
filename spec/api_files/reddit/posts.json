That would show potential employers my programming skills, my ability to work on projects from start to finish and that my Salesforce skills can actually be transferable.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\n\nHopefully by switching to mobile dev I could also avoid the pressure of getting as many certifications as possible and keeping up with them through the maintenance exam for each major Salesforce release.\n\n\n\nEDIT: sorry for the wall of text and thanks for reading :)\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "saved": false, "id": "7yf2qu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anthrowaway_account", "num_crossposts": 0, "link_flair_text": null, "mod_reports": [], "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "edited": 1518970202.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "author_flair_text": null, "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "name": "t3_7yf2qu", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yf2qu/salesforce_consultant_thinking_of_switching_to/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "hide_score": false, "created": 1518998297.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yf2qu/salesforce_consultant_thinking_of_switching_to/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "quarantine": false, "title": "Salesforce Consultant thinking of switching to mobile dev", "created_utc": 1518969497.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "ups": 6, "media": null, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "mod_note": null, "is_video": false, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.cscareerquestions", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "num_reports": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, I am currently a junior in college.

Unfortunately, I fell into a long depressive episode (likely caused by then undiagnosed ADHD that I\u2019m now receiving treatment for) which led to my academic dismissal from school that semester. I was still able to complete my summer internship doing admittedly mediocre work, but my depression only worsened until the past month or two.

I know I\u2019m quite late in the game and my situation probably leaves me as a mostly undesirable candidate, so I don\u2019t really know where to begin this time around. I started applying for Summer 2017 jobs in September and had already had accepted my job offer by this time, but I have yet to submit a single application this year. To make matters worse, I feel like I have lost the small network I had built because I was completely withdrawn for most of the past year. My first thought was to attempt a return to my old company, but they have a rigorous background check process which would certainly show that I had flunked out of college. With those possibilities ruled out, I was hoping somebody would be gracious enough to help steer me in the right direction and answer my questions which I\u2019ll list below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though it\u2019s so late in the season, would it be in my best interest to quickly throw some projects together prior to sending out applications (I\u2019ve hardly touched any of my projects since last spring) or should I just apply ASAP? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of companies do you think I\u2019d have the best success with? I was thinking I might have more luck with startups that align with my interests/past work as I would imagine they\u2019d be less likely to look into my educational status and recruit later in the application cycle. If it\u2019s worth noting, I currently live in the DC/Baltimore area and could easily move back with my parents in NY for the summer. I am also open to relocating as long as my pay is enough to break even with rent/living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I do choose to focus on startups should I cold-email companies looking for a position even if they don\u2019t have any postings for internships?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When applying, is there any way I can cover up my academic status without being dishonest?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it even worth searching for an internship at this point in the season and with my situation or should I just focus all my energy on getting back into my university?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being this is likely my last summer before graduation (if I return this fall, I would graduate in two semesters + a summer course or two), how much would not having an internship this summer hurt my post-graduation job prospects after being an intern last year?

I was thinking I might have more luck with startups that align with my interests/past work as I would imagine they\u2019d be less likely to look into my educational status and recruit later in the application cycle. If it\u2019s worth noting, I currently live in the DC/Baltimore area and could easily move back with my parents in NY for the summer. I am also open to relocating as long as my pay is enough to break even with rent/living expenses.\n\nIf I do choose to focus on startups should I cold-email companies looking for a position even if they don\u2019t have any postings for internships?\n\nWhen applying, is there any way I can cover up my academic status without being dishonest?\n\nIs it even worth searching for an internship at this point in the season and with my situation or should I just focus all my energy on getting back into my university?\n\nBeing this is likely my last summer before graduation (if I return this fall, I would graduate in two semesters + a summer course or two), how much would not having an internship this summer hurt my post-graduation job prospects after being an intern last year?  Keep in mind that this would be coupled by my abysmal GPA that was mostly killed by the semester preceding my dismissal.\n\nI apologize for this post being long and all over the place, I\u2019m just feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment. I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and/or offer advice!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "saved": false, "id": "7yfuuu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "throwawayandaway232", "num_crossposts": 0, "link_flair_text": null, "mod_reports": [], "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "author_flair_text": null, "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "name": "t3_7yfuuu", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yfuuu/flunked_out_of_school_with_depressionadhd_how_can/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "hide_score": false, "created": 1519005002.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yfuuu/flunked_out_of_school_with_depressionadhd_how_can/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "quarantine": false, "title": "Flunked out of school with Depression/ADHD.
