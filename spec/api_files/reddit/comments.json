I'd like to just address your concerns if I may.\n\nFirst of all, what we're mainly looking for when we evaluate students is a commitment to the program and a passable grasp of core concepts in their field. For example for CS students, we're looking for a basic understanding of data structures and algorithms. This is because we are not a CS bootcamp -- we're a career accelerator. We help with other things on top of that which I personally believe are very valuable (I'll go over some of the concrete impact we make at the end of this response).\n\nNext, Blueprint is a student organization and I make it clear by literally saying \"Directed a nonprofit organization that guides **students** in developing web and mobile apps for other nonprofits pro bono\" in my description of the organization. I also make no attempt to hide the organization and I link it directly on my LinkedIn. If you question whether or not I was the president of the organization while I was in it, please feel free to see the official page here (https://www.calblueprint.org/about) and **Ctrl+F for 'Kevin Wu' and you'll see that I'm listed as President under the Alumni section.** Jessica was also a previous president and she's one of my close friends, but you can ask her yourself and she'd confirm my presidency status.\n\nAnother point: one of the first things I tell each and every one of our prospective fellows is that I'm young (which should be obvious, looking at my profile picture on LinkedIn). From my perspective, this uniquely equips me, as an advisor who recently went through the same problems that students are going through right now, to give valuable advice. Rather than being decades removed from the university recruiting process, I've been on both sides of the table, in both hiring and recruiting, very recently. It's not something I'm trying to hide.\n\nFinally, here's how we see the program and the tuition cost. We understand that 7% for 12 months or 28% for 3 months is a big commitment, but the fellows we advise improve their job seeking prospects and career by astronomically more than just 7% for the next year. Beyond just getting you better opportunities with higher salaries, our negotiation advice alone can account for a salary increase of over 10%. Every single part of our program, from teaching you how to do outreach that will 4X your response rate (5% to 20%) to interview preparation that improves your coding test scores by an average of 2 points on a 6 point scale, is designed to statistically improve your odds way more than what you commit in return.\n\nMaybe it's your opinion that Pathrise is not a good deal. I respect your opinion and your thoughts. However, I'm working on this company because I honestly believe we make a huge difference in the careers of our students. I see it in every hour every day I spend advising them and helping them reach their aspirations.\n\n\n\n", "link_title": "Pathrise career accelerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;dobbysreward: I&amp;#39;m Kevin - the CEO and founder of Pathrise.

We help with other things on top of that which I personally believe are very valuable (I&amp;#39;ll go over some of the concrete impact we make at the end of this response).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, Blueprint is a student organization and I make it clear by literally saying &amp;quot;Directed a nonprofit organization that guides &lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt; in developing web and mobile apps for other nonprofits pro bono&amp;quot; in my description of the organization. I also make no attempt to hide the organization and I link it directly on my LinkedIn. If you question whether or not I was the president of the organization while I was in it, please feel free to see the official page here (&lt;a href=\"https://www.calblueprint.org/about\"&gt;https://www.calblueprint.org/about&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+F for &amp;#39;Kevin Wu&amp;#39; and you&amp;#39;ll see that I&amp;#39;m listed as President under the Alumni section.&lt;/strong&gt; Jessica was also a previous president and she&amp;#39;s one of my close friends, but you can ask her yourself and she&amp;#39;d confirm my presidency status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another point: one of the first things I tell each and every one of our prospective fellows is that I&amp;#39;m young (which should be obvious, looking at my profile picture on LinkedIn). From my perspective, this uniquely equips me, as an advisor who recently went through the same problems that students are going through right now, to give valuable advice. Rather than being decades removed from the university recruiting process, I&amp;#39;ve been on both sides of the table, in both hiring and recruiting, very recently. It&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m trying to hide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, here&amp;#39;s how we see the program and the tuition cost. We understand that 7% for 12 months or 28% for 3 months is a big commitment, but the fellows we advise improve their job seeking prospects and career by astronomically more than just 7% for the next year. Beyond just getting you better opportunities with higher salaries, our negotiation advice alone can account for a salary increase of over 10%. Every single part of our program, from teaching you how to do outreach that will 4X your response rate (5% to 20%) to interview preparation that improves your coding test scores by an average of 2 points on a 6 point scale, is designed to statistically improve your odds way more than what you commit in return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s your opinion that Pathrise is not a good deal. I respect your opinion and your thoughts. However, I&amp;#39;m working on this company because I honestly believe we make a huge difference in the careers of our students. I see it in every hour every day I spend advising them and helping them reach their aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "distinguished": null, "quarantine": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_du9utdq", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xew2i/pathrise_career_accelerator/du9utdq/", "num_reports": null, "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xew2i/pathrise_career_accelerator/", "stickied": false, "created": 1518700426.0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xew2i/pathrise_career_accelerator/", "created_utc": 1518671626.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "approved_at_utc": null, "edited": 1518671899.0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7xjwdx", "link_author": "Cellayna", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "du9ut39", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dtechnology", "num_comments": 68, "can_mod_post": false, "parent_id": "t1_du9u4q5", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "mod_note": null, "collapsed": false, "body": "[That ruling was based on the very controversial anti-circumvention clause of the DMCA](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/08/the-88-million-server-private-wow-server-op-loses-big/) (same which makes ripping a DVD illegal in the US), not on copyright.", "link_title": "How to add a Pok\u00e9mon rom hack to my portfolio without seeming unprofessional ?", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/08/the-88-million-server-private-wow-server-op-loses-big/\"&gt;That ruling was based on the very controversial anti-circumvention clause of the DMCA&lt;/a&gt; (same which makes ripping a DVD illegal in the US), not on copyright.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "distinguished": null, "quarantine": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_du9ut39", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xjwdx/how_to_add_a_pok\u00e9mon_rom_hack_to_my_portfolio/du9ut39/", "num_reports": null, "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xjwdx/how_to_add_a_pok\u00e9mon_rom_hack_to_my_portfolio/", "stickied": false, "created": 1518700416.0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xjwdx/how_to_add_a_pok\u00e9mon_rom_hack_to_my_portfolio/", "created_utc": 1518671616.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "approved_at_utc": null, "edited": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7xlubi", "link_author": "dapperpapple", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "du9uq44", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "149244179", "num_comments": 5, "can_mod_post": false, "parent_id": "t3_7xlubi", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "mod_note": null, "collapsed": false, "body": "There are thousands of companies.
